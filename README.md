# ECSense

"EC Sense" is intended to be used as a cost-effective four-wire electrical conductivity meter for use in water applications. The repository is broken down into a few key sections:

1. Assembly - Containing information on how to build "EC Sense" through PCBWay or other PCB assembly service.
2. Software - Arduino software uploadable to Feather M0 microcontroller for using returning data from "EC Sense." Provides a launchpad for building a software library for interfacing with the hardware.
3. Board - "PCBWay" (containing the Gerber/Drill/Pick-and-Place/BOM files ready to upload to PCBWay), "Autodesk Fusion 360 Archive" (containing .f3z archive of electronics design).
