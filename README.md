4) Under "PCB Specification Selection" click "+Add Gerber File" and upload "Gerber.zip" from the repository. After the gerber files archive has been uploaded, enter the desired quantity under "Quantity (single)." This quantity will need to match the quantity of assembled units, which will be addressed in a later step.
